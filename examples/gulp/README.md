# Using the Gulp starter

First, install the dependencies with [npm]:

```sh
npm install
```

Once you've done this, you can modify [src/js/main.js](src/js/main.js) and run
the following command to build `js/main.js` and its complimentary [source map]:

```sh
npm run build:js
```

To build CSS from [src/css/main.scss], run:

```sh
npm run build:css
```

To build both js and css run: 

```sh
npm run build
```
